# Taggit

[Taggit](https://www.designsafe-ci.org/ds-use-case/haan/usecase/) allows users to browse images files on DesignSafe and tag them for 
later use in analysis or mapping applications. It also easily connects to [HazMapper](https://github.com/TACC-Cloud/hazmapper) to map image locations. 

## Development setup

Use node v14.x, run:

```
npm install
npm run start.
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
